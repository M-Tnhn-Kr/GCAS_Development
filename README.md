# F16 Ground Collision Avoidance System

## Introduction

This repository presents a framework for developing a Ground Collision Avoidance System (GCAS) for the F16 aircraft. The primary goal is to create a decision-making mechanism that utilizes a cost function and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to effectively prevent ground collisions during various flight scenarios.

### Background

Ground collisions pose significant risks during takeoff, landing, and low-altitude maneuvers. An effective GCAS is crucial for enhancing the safety of F16 operations, ensuring that pilots are alerted to potential collisions with the ground or obstacles. By integrating advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, we aim to create a system that not only identifies potential hazards but also proposes optimal avoidance actions.

### Objectives

- Develop a cost function that quantifies the risk of ground collision based on various parameters such as altitude, speed, terrain, and pilot actions.
- Implement a decision-making mechanism that leverages RL to learn from past flight data and improve collision avoidance strategies.
- Create a simulation environment to test and validate the performance of the proposed GCAS.

### Key Features

- **Cost Function**: A mathematical representation of the risk associated with ground proximity, providing feedback to the RL model.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: An adaptive learning approach that enhances decision-making capabilities over time by interacting with the environment.
- **Simulation Framework**: A platform for testing and refining the GCAS in various flight scenarios.
